*This repository contains a number of exercises in building a basic HTTP Server*


The basic echo_server.py is a simple echo server, when run in the terminal, will respond to requests sent from another terminal using the echo_client.py.

The slightly more advanced http1_server.py will respond to basic GET requests and return a response code based on the method and HTTP version.

The http2_server.py is a more advanced server that will actually serve basic files in the webroot directory.
